## TDR Generated GraphQL

This project generates, packages and deploys the case classes generated by the [sbt-graphql](https://github.com/muuki88/sbt-graphql) project to the sonatype nexus.

These classes are be used by other TDR repositories to communicate with the consignment API.

### Building locally
* If you add a new query file to `src/main/graphql`:
* Add a schema file generated by the [consignment api](https://github.com/nationalarchives/tdr-consignment-api) project. This will be generated in the `target/sbt-graphql` directory and should be copied into `src/main/resources/schema.graphql`
* Run `sbt package publishLocal` - This allows you to use your updated version of the API locally to facilitate work on FE (This helps as sometimes Jenkins can be slow to build and catch up etc.)

### Releasing
* Commit and push the new query file that sits in `src/main/graphql`
* Merge to master.
* This project will be built by the deploy job for the consignment API but can be also run manually.

#####To Run Jenkins Manually:
* Go to the TDR Graphql Code Generation job in Jenkins. 
* Click on 'Build with parameters'
* Leave STAGE option as 'intg' and paste the schema from the consignemnt api repo into the SCHEMA section.
* You can look at the console output when/after you run the jenkins build to help bug fix etc.
