## TDR Generated GraphQL

This project generates, packages and deploys the case classes generated by the [sbt-graphql](https://github.com/muuki88/sbt-graphql) project to the sonatype nexus.

These classes are used by other TDR repositories to communicate with the consignment API.

### Building locally
* Add a new query file to `src/main/graphql`:
* Add a schema file generated by the [consignment api](https://github.com/nationalarchives/tdr-consignment-api) project. This will be generated in the `target/sbt-graphql` directory and should be copied into `src/main/resources/schema.graphql`
* Run `sbt package publishLocal` - This allows you to check that your changes work locally before submitting them for review/merge to master.

### Releasing
* Commit and push the new query file that sits in `src/main/graphql`
* Open a pull request, and merge to master once it has been reviewed.
* This project should be run manually in Jenkins.

#### To Run Jenkins Manually
* Go to the TDR Graphql Code Generation job in Jenkins. 
* Click on 'Build with parameters'
* Leave STAGE option as 'intg' and paste the schema from the consignemnt api repo into the SCHEMA section.
* You can look at the console output when/after you run the jenkins build to help bug fix etc.
